We try to maintain a comprehensive set of documentation for various audiences. However, we realize that often there are questions that remain unanswered. For any technical questions relating to Bithumb Chain not answered here, please use StackOverflow. Another approach to getting your questions answered to send an email to the mailing list (faq@Bithumbchain.io), or ask your questions on RocketChat (an alternative to Slack) on the #Bithumb-Chain or #Bithumb-Chain-questions channel.

.. note:: Please, when asking about problems you are facing tell us
          about the environment in which you are experiencing those
          problems including the OS, which version of Docker you are
          using, etc.
